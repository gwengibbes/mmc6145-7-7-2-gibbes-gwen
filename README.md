# About the Application
The application will be a travel website that is intended for travelers to help them with planning their trips. 
The purpose of this application is for people who are interested in traveling and are unsure about places to visit upon arrival.
It connects the travelers with information about travel destinations. 
Users will be able to create an account, log in and see various activities that are available in specific destinations. 

The technical features of the application include an external API, https://developers.amadeus.com/get-started/get-started-with-self-service-apis-335,  pages or views of the application, and the use of MongoDB to store the user details and the activities that the users would like to do at a specific destination. The Environmental Variables necessary will be the key for the API and the session key. The pages or views that the application will contain will be a Home page, a Bucket List page, a Visited page and a Details Page.

The mockup above shows the general layout and design that was intended for the website. 
The intended look and feel of the website was meant to follow, roughly, the view shown above. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
